# IB Insync Implementation Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the implementation steps for integrating the `ib_insync` library in our Interactive Brokers trading application. The implementation is divided into five key steps, each focusing on a different aspect of the API wrapper.

## Implementation Structure

The implementation follows a step-by-step approach, with each step building on the previous one:

1. **Setup and Initial Structure** - Basic setup and framework
2. **Connection Management** - Connecting to and disconnecting from IBKR
3. **Market Data Retrieval** - Getting stock data and option chains
4. **Order Management** - Placing, monitoring, and canceling orders
5. **Account and Position Management** - Tracking account information and positions

## Step 1: Setup and Initial Structure

[View full documentation](ib-insync-step1-setup.md)

In this step, we:
- Install required dependencies
- Set up project configuration
- Create the initial `IBKRIBInsyncApi` class
- Update the factory method

This establishes the foundation for the rest of the implementation.

## Step 2: Connection Management

[View full documentation](ib-insync-step2-connection.md)

This step focuses on:
- Implementing event handlers for connection events
- Adding connection and disconnection methods
- Handling error events
- Setting up testing for connection management

These components ensure reliable connectivity to the Interactive Brokers platform.

## Step 3: Market Data Retrieval

[View full documentation](ib-insync-step3-market-data.md)

This step implements:
- Real-time market data retrieval for stocks
- Option chain retrieval with greeks and implied volatility
- Error handling for invalid symbols
- Testing for market data functionality

These functions allow the application to get current market prices and available options.

## Step 4: Order Management

[View full documentation](ib-insync-step4-order-management.md)

This step implements:
- Order placement for option spreads
- Order status tracking
- Order cancellation
- Testing for various order scenarios

These components enable the application to execute trading strategies.

## Step 5: Account and Position Management

[View full documentation](ib-insync-step5-account-management.md)

This step implements:
- Account summary retrieval
- Position tracking
- Integration with the main trader class
- Testing for account and position functionality

These functions allow for monitoring account status and positions.

## Implementation Guide

To implement the full solution, follow these steps in order:

1. Follow the setup instructions in Step 1
2. Implement connection management from Step 2
3. Add market data functionality from Step 3
4. Implement order management from Step 4
5. Add account and position tracking from Step 5
6. Update your main application to use the new implementation

## Testing

Each implementation step includes comprehensive tests using pytest and pytest-bdd with Gherkin scenarios. To run all tests:

```bash
# Run all IB Insync tests
pytest tests/test_ibkr_*.py

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_ibkr_connection.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/test_ibkr_*.py --cov=src.brokers
```

## Using the Implementation

To use the implementation in your application:

1. Enable in your configuration:
   ```yaml
   ibkr:
     use_ib_insync: true
   ```

2. Ensure Interactive Brokers TWS or Gateway is running and configured to allow API connections
3. Use the broker API through the factory method:
   ```python
   from src.brokers import get_broker_api
   
   # Use with ib_insync (default)
   broker_api = get_broker_api(config, use_ib_insync=True)
   
   # Connect to IBKR
   connected = broker_api.connect()
   ```
