## Comprehensive TraderAdmin GUI Roadmap

### Overview and Goals

Create a robust trading platform combining a Wails GUI, Kubernetes/Docker backend, and IBKR Trader Workstation integration to support advanced trading and risk management. The GUI will feature real-time monitoring, comprehensive strategy settings, and smooth pause-edit-unpause workflows.

------

### Phase 1: Foundation & Backend Setup (Week 1-2)

**Goals:**

- Initialize Wails (Svelte/Go) GUI
- Set up Docker and Kubernetes integration
- Centralize configuration

**Tasks:**

- Scaffold Wails project (`wails init -n TraderAdmin -t svelte-ts`)
- Configure Docker SDK and Kubernetes client
- Consolidate all tunable parameters into `config.toml`
- Implement live configuration reload (SIGUSR1 for Python, fsnotify for Go)

**Gherkin Scenario:**

```gherkin
Feature: Config Reload
Scenario: Live reload on configuration change
  Given python-orchestrator and go-scanner running
  When config.toml is updated and SIGUSR1 sent
  Then services reload configuration immediately
```

------

### Phase 2: Core GUI Components (Week 2-3)

**Goals:**

- Design and implement core UI tabs
- Build interactive forms with JSON schema validation

**Tabs:**

- Overview
- IBKR Connection
- Trading & Risk
- Strategies
- Options
- Universe
- Scanner
- Data Management
- Logging
- Scheduling & Execution
- Monitoring & Alerts
- Backup & Restore
- Developer Tools
- Help & Documentation

**Tasks:**

- Generate forms dynamically from JSON schema
- Integrate backend methods for config I/O

**Gherkin Scenario:**

```gherkin
Feature: Tab Navigation
Scenario: Navigate between tabs
  Given the TraderAdmin GUI is open
  When user clicks on "Options"
  Then options strategy settings are displayed
```

------

### Phase 3: Advanced Trading Features & Enhancements (Week 3-4)

**Goals:**

- Implement enhanced trading strategies and options controls
- Add risk management and liquidity filters

**Tasks:**

- Include advanced parameters (IV rank, Vega exposure, POP)
- Implement position sizing and dynamic DTE selection
- Setup real-time options chain viewer

**Gherkin Scenario:**

```gherkin
Feature: Advanced Options Filters
Scenario: Exclude low-liquidity contracts
  Given an options chain for "AAPL"
  When MinOpenInterest=1000 and MaxBidAskSpreadPct=0.5
  Then only highly liquid contracts are listed
```

------

### Phase 4: Save, Restart, and Scheduling Workflow (Week 4-5)

**Goals:**

- Implement pause/edit/unpause functionality with Docker/Kubernetes
- Configure automatic and manual trade scheduling

**Tasks:**

- Implement PauseStack, SaveConfig, UnpauseStack methods
- Integrate scheduling cron jobs

**Gherkin Scenario:**

```gherkin
Feature: Save and Restart Workflow
Scenario: Successfully save and restart
  Given valid configurations entered
  When user clicks "Save & Restart"
  Then containers pause, configurations update, and containers resume
```

------

### Phase 5: Real-Time Monitoring & Alert Systems (Week 5-6)

**Goals:**

- Real-time dashboard for performance metrics
- Implement alert notifications (Email, SMS, Slack)

**Tasks:**

- Display current equity, daily P&L, win/loss ratio
- Setup configurable alert triggers

**Gherkin Scenario:**

```gherkin
Feature: Real-Time Monitoring
Scenario: Receive alert on high latency
  Given a trade execution latency threshold set
  When latency exceeds threshold
  Then an alert is sent via configured channels
```

------

### Phase 6: Error Handling & Recovery (Week 6)

**Goals:**

- Robust error logging and recovery mechanisms

**Tasks:**

- Implement structured error logging
- Develop automatic recovery procedures

**Gherkin Scenario:**

```gherkin
Feature: Error Recovery
Scenario: Recover from IBKR API disconnection
  Given IBKR API connection lost
  When recovery protocol initiated
  Then connection automatically reestablishes
```

------

### Phase 7: Comprehensive Testing & Documentation (Week 6+)

**Goals:**

- Execute end-to-end Cucumber tests
- Complete user and developer documentation

**Tasks:**

- Finalize detailed documentation
- Automate integration tests

**Gherkin Scenario:**

```gherkin
Feature: End-to-End Testing
Scenario: Full system integration test
  Given system components running
  When end-to-end test scenarios executed
  Then all tests pass successfully
```

------

### Future Extensions:

- Rollback configurations
- RBAC & JWT Authentication
- Cluster-Agnostic deployments

This roadmap provides a structured, actionable path for building a sophisticated, reliable, and user-friendly trading application, seamlessly integrating GUI enhancements, backend robustness, and comprehensive testing for confident deployment.
