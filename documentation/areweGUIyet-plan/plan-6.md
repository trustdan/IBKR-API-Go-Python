Okay, looking back at the overarching plan and the phases we've defined, Phase 6 in the original roadmap was focused on **Testing & Documentation**. This seems like a very logical next step that fits your criteria perfectly – it adds necessary robustness and polish without introducing significant *new* feature complexity, password protection, or submodules.

Here’s a potential "Plan 6: Testing, Documentation & Polish" echoed back to you:

### Revised Plan 6: Testing, Documentation & Polish

**Timeline:** ~1 - 2 weeks

**Preamble:** With the core features implemented, this phase focuses on ensuring the application's quality, stability, and maintainability. We will establish more comprehensive testing strategies, create essential documentation for both users and developers, and perform general code cleanup and UI polish based on the development so far.

**Objective:** Solidify the application through rigorous testing, provide clear documentation, refine the user experience, and prepare the codebase for potential future enhancements or deployment.

------

#### 6.1 Comprehensive Testing Strategy

1.  **Unit Testing:**
    * **Go Backend:** Implement unit tests for key functions, especially configuration parsing/validation, API handlers, and any complex logic (e.g., metrics calculation, filtering logic helpers). Utilize Go's built-in testing package and mocks for external dependencies (like Kubernetes client or IBKR interfaces where applicable).
    * **Python Orchestrator:** Add unit tests for critical components like the scheduling logic, alert condition evaluation, and any core strategy execution helpers. Use `unittest` or `pytest` and mocking libraries.
    * **Svelte Frontend:** Implement unit tests for crucial Svelte components and stores, particularly the `DynamicForm` logic, store interactions (`configStore`, `statusStore`, `metricsStore`), and any complex UI logic. Consider using tools like Vitest or Jest with Testing Library.

2.  **Integration Testing:**
    * **Service Interaction:** Design tests to verify the interaction between the Go backend and the Python orchestrator (if they communicate directly, e.g., via gRPC or another mechanism for metrics/events).
    * **Backend & K8s/Docker:** Write tests (potentially using test containers or a local Kind/k3d cluster) to verify the backend's ability to interact with Kubernetes/Docker for pausing/resuming services as implemented in Phase 4.

3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    * **Core Workflows:** Expand on the Gherkin scenarios to create automated E2E tests covering critical user paths:
        * Loading the application and seeing initial state.
        * Loading configuration from the backend.
        * Making changes in the GUI, applying them via "Apply Configuration", and verifying services restart/reload.
        * Simulating conditions that trigger alerts and verifying notifications (requires mocking notification endpoints).
        * Verifying dashboard updates based on simulated backend metric changes.
    * **Tools:** Explore options for E2E testing Wails applications (this might involve tools that can interact with web views like Playwright or Cypress, depending on Wails' testing capabilities, or potentially custom Go-based testing).

4.  **Refine Gherkin Scenarios:**
    * Review all existing Gherkin scenarios from Phases 1-5. Ensure they are clear, accurate, and provide good coverage. Implement any missing step definitions needed for automated testing.

------

#### 6.2 Documentation

1.  **User Documentation:**
    * **README.md:** Enhance the main project README with clear instructions on prerequisites, installation (building the Wails app, setting up Docker/Kubernetes), initial configuration, and basic usage.
    * **Configuration Guide:** Create a separate document (`CONFIGURATION.md` or similar) detailing every section and parameter in `config.toml`, explaining its purpose, valid values, and potential impact.
    * **GUI Guide:** Basic walkthrough of the GUI tabs and core functionalities (connecting, configuring, monitoring, applying changes). Include screenshots.

2.  **Developer Documentation:**
    * **Code Structure:** Document the overall project layout (`GUI-overarching-plan.md` is a good start, refine it).
    * **Backend API:** Document the Wails Go backend functions exposed to the frontend (inputs, outputs, purpose). Consider auto-generating docs from code comments (e.g., using GoDoc).
    * **Setup Guide:** Instructions for developers on how to set up the development environment (Go, Node.js, Wails CLI, Docker, K8s).
    * **Contribution Guidelines:** (Optional) If applicable, define guidelines for contributing code, running tests, and submitting changes.

------

#### 6.3 Code Refinement & UI Polish

1.  **Code Cleanup:**
    * Review code in Go, Python, and Svelte/TS for clarity, consistency, and adherence to best practices.
    * Refactor complex functions or components.
    * Remove dead code or unused dependencies.
    * Ensure proper error handling throughout the backend and frontend.

2.  **UI/UX Polish:**
    * Address any minor layout issues, inconsistencies, or usability quirks identified during development or testing.
    * Improve loading states and user feedback for long-running operations (like "Apply Configuration").
    * Ensure consistent styling and terminology across all tabs.
    * Test responsiveness if the window is resized (though Wails apps are often fixed-size or have limited resizing).

3.  **Dependency Review:**
    * Check for updates to key dependencies (Go modules, Python packages, NPM packages) and update where feasible and safe.

#### 6.4 Testing & Validation (Behavior Defined with Gherkin)

```gherkin
Feature: Testing and Documentation Completeness

  Scenario: Running Unit Tests
    Given the project codebase with unit tests implemented
    When the unit test suites for Go, Python, and Svelte are executed
    Then all unit tests pass successfully

  Scenario: Running Integration Tests
    Given the project codebase with integration tests implemented
    When the integration test suite (e.g., testing backend-K8s interaction) is executed
    Then all integration tests pass successfully

  Scenario: Executing End-to-End Test for Configuration Workflow
    Given an automated E2E test environment is set up
    When the E2E test script simulates loading the app, changing a config value, and applying the configuration
    Then the test verifies that services are paused, config is saved, services resume, and the change is reflected after reload, all without test failure

  Scenario: Accessing User Documentation
    Given the project repository
    When a user accesses the README.md and CONFIGURATION.md files
    Then the files contain clear, comprehensive instructions and explanations for setup and configuration

  Scenario: Reviewing Code Quality
    Given the completed codebase for phases 1-5
    When a code review or static analysis is performed
    Then the code demonstrates consistent style, good commenting, and proper error handling, with identified issues addressed
```

#### 6.5 Deliverables for Phase 6

- Implemented unit tests for backend (Go, Python) and frontend (Svelte) components.
- Implemented integration tests for key service interactions (e.g., backend-K8s).
- Implemented automated E2E tests covering critical user workflows.
- Comprehensive User Documentation (README, Configuration Guide, Basic GUI Guide).
- Developer Documentation (Code Structure, API Docs, Setup Guide).
- Refined codebase with improved clarity, error handling, and consistency.
- Polished UI with fixes for minor bugs and usability improvements.
- Passing Gherkin scenarios related to testing and documentation availability.
