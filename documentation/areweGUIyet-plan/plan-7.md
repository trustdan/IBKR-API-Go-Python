Okay, we can certainly modify Plan 7 to include steps for creating a Windows installer using NSIS. This fits well within the "Deployment Preparation & Packaging" theme.

Here's the revised "Plan 7: Deployment Preparation, Packaging & Windows Installer" echoed back to you:

### Revised Plan 7: Deployment Preparation, Packaging & Windows Installer

**Timeline:** ~1 week (could extend slightly with installer scripting)

**Preamble:** Following comprehensive testing and documentation (Plan 6), this phase focuses on preparing the TraderAdmin application for distribution, particularly for Windows users via an installer, and for potential deployment into a target server environment. This involves creating distributable application packages (including a Windows installer), refining deployment artifacts (Docker images, Kubernetes manifests), adding health checks, and documenting the deployment procedures.

**Objective:** Package the Wails application into platform-specific executables and a user-friendly Windows installer, optimize container images, finalize Kubernetes deployment configurations, implement basic health checks, and document the steps required to deploy and run the TraderAdmin system.

------

#### 7.1 Application Packaging & Windows Installer

1.  **Wails Production Builds:**
    * Utilize the `wails build` command to create production-ready executables for target operating systems (e.g., Windows `.exe`, macOS `.app`, Linux binary).
    * Ensure build flags are set correctly (e.g., stripping debug symbols `-ldflags="-s -w"`).
    * Test the built executables on their respective target platforms to ensure they launch and function correctly.
    * Document any platform-specific prerequisites or steps needed to run the packaged application.

2.  **Windows Installer Creation (NSIS):**
    * **Prerequisite:** Install NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) on the build machine.
    * **Create NSIS Script (`.nsi`):**
        * Develop an NSIS script (e.g., `TraderAdmin/build_scripts/windows_installer.nsi`) to define the installer's behavior and appearance.
        * The script should include:
            * Installer metadata (Product Name, Version, Publisher, Icon).
            * License agreement page.
            * Installation directory selection.
            * Packaging of the Wails-built `TraderAdmin.exe` (from step 7.1.1).
            * Inclusion of any necessary supporting files (e.g., a default `config.toml.example`, `README.html`, `LICENSE.txt`).
            * Creation of Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts.
            * Uninstaller creation and registration (for Add/Remove Programs).
            * Optional: Check for prerequisites (e.g., specific Windows version, WebView2 runtime if not bundled by Wails).
    * **Compile NSIS Script:**
        * Use the NSIS compiler (`makensis.exe`) to process the `.nsi` script and generate the Windows installer executable (e.g., `TraderAdmin_Setup_vX.Y.Z.exe`).
    * **Test Windows Installer:**
        * Thoroughly test the generated installer on various Windows versions (e.g., Windows 10, Windows 11).
        * Verify installation, shortcut creation, application launch from shortcuts, and uninstallation.

------

#### 7.2 Container Image Optimization

1.  **Refine Dockerfiles:**
    * Review the Dockerfiles for the Go backend, Python orchestrator, and any other custom services.
    * Implement multi-stage builds to minimize final image sizes.
    * Ensure base images are reasonably up-to-date and secure.
    * Optimize layer caching.
    * Specify non-root users for running applications within containers.
    * Build and tag final images with appropriate versioning schemes.

------

#### 7.3 Kubernetes Manifest Finalization

1.  **Review & Refine Manifests (`TraderAdmin/deploy/`):**
    * **Namespaces:** Deploy into a dedicated Kubernetes namespace (e.g., `traderadmin`).
    * **Resource Requests & Limits:** Define sensible CPU and memory requests/limits.
    * **Readiness & Liveness Probes:** Implement for each service.
    * **Configuration Management:** Confirm PVC setup and volume mounts.
    * **Service Exposure (If Needed):** Define Kubernetes Services (e.g., ClusterIP).

------

#### 7.4 Health Check Endpoints

1.  **Implement Basic Health Endpoints:**
    * **Go Backend:** Add a simple HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/healthz`) for Kubernetes probes.
    * **Python Orchestrator:** Add a similar basic health check endpoint.

------

#### 7.5 Deployment Documentation

1.  **Create `DEPLOYMENT.md`:**
    * Document prerequisites for server-side deployment (Kubernetes cluster, Docker).
    * Step-by-step instructions for deploying services using manifests.
    * Instructions for building/pushing Docker images.
    * How to access logs, basic troubleshooting.
    * Update and backup/restore procedures.
2.  **Update User Documentation (`README.md` or specific Install Guide):**
    * Add instructions for Windows users on how to download and run the `TraderAdmin_Setup.exe` installer.
    * Mention any prerequisites for the desktop application (e.g., WebView2, though Wails often handles this).

#### 7.6 Testing & Validation (Behavior Defined with Gherkin)

```gherkin
Feature: Deployment Preparation, Packaging, and Windows Installer Validation

  Scenario: Building Production Application Package (Wails)
    Given the TraderAdmin source code is finalized
    When the `wails build` command is executed for Windows
    Then a `TraderAdmin.exe` is created in the build output directory
    And the executable runs successfully on a Windows test environment

  Scenario: Creating and Testing Windows Installer (NSIS)
    Given NSIS is installed and an `windows_installer.nsi` script is prepared
    And the Wails-built `TraderAdmin.exe` and other assets are available
    When the NSIS script is compiled
    Then a `TraderAdmin_Setup_vX.Y.Z.exe` installer is generated
    And the installer successfully installs the application on a Windows test environment
    And shortcuts are created as specified
    And the application launches correctly from the shortcuts
    And the uninstaller removes the application and shortcuts cleanly

  Scenario: Deploying Services to Kubernetes
    Given Docker images for all services are built and available
    And Kubernetes manifests in 'TraderAdmin/deploy/' are finalized
    When the user applies the Kubernetes manifests to a target cluster
    Then all required Deployments, Services, and PVCs are created
    And all Pods eventually reach the 'Running' state and pass their readiness probes

  Scenario: Verifying Health Checks in Kubernetes
    Given the TraderAdmin services are deployed and running in Kubernetes
    When Kubernetes checks the liveness and readiness probes
    Then the probes consistently succeed for healthy pods
    And appropriate actions are taken for unhealthy pods

  Scenario: Accessing Deployment and Installation Documentation
    Given the project repository
    When a user accesses DEPLOYMENT.md and the user-facing installation instructions
    Then the documentation provides clear guidance for server-side deployment and Windows installation respectively
```

#### 7.7 Deliverables for Phase 7

- Optimized Dockerfiles and built/tagged production-ready Docker images.
- Finalized Kubernetes manifests (`TraderAdmin/deploy/*.yaml`) with health probes, resource limits, etc.
- Basic health check endpoints in backend services.
- Packaged Wails application executables for target platforms (especially `TraderAdmin.exe` for Windows).
- **NSIS script (`TraderAdmin/build_scripts/windows_installer.nsi`) for creating the Windows installer.**
- **Windows installer executable (`TraderAdmin_Setup_vX.Y.Z.exe`).**
- Comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT.md` for server-side deployment.
- Updated user documentation including Windows installer instructions.
- Passing Gherkin scenarios covering Wails build, NSIS installer, Kubernetes deployment, and health checks.

------

> **Conclusion:** After this phase, TraderAdmin is not only prepared for server-side deployment but also easily distributable and installable as a desktop application on Windows. This significantly enhances its accessibility for end-users.
