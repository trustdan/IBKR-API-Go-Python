# IB Insync Implementation: Step 1 - Setup and Initial Structure Completed

## Work Completed

1. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Verified that `ib_insync` and `pytz` packages were already installed in the project
   - Updated requirements.txt to specify newer versions

2. **Created Class Structure**
   - Created the `IBKRIBInsyncApi` class in `python/src/brokers/ibkr_ib_insync.py`
   - Implemented initialization with proper configuration parameters
   - Set up instance variables for tracking connection state, orders, and positions

3. **Updated Factory Method**
   - Updated `python/src/brokers/__init__.py` to include the new implementation
   - Added factory method `get_broker_api()` that can switch between implementations

4. **Updated Configuration**
   - Added IBKR API settings to `config.yaml`
   - Configured connection parameters, timeouts, and other settings

5. **Added Tests**
   - Created unit tests for the setup in `python/tests/unit/test_ibkr_ib_insync_setup.py`
   - Created BDD tests with Gherkin scenarios in `python/tests/features/setup.feature`
   - Implemented the test steps using pytest-bdd

## Next Steps

After completing this setup, you're now ready to move on to [Step 2 - Connection Management](ib-insync-step2-connection.md), which will implement:

1. Event handlers for connection events
2. Connection and disconnection methods
3. Error handling
4. Callback processing

## Notes for Testing

To run the tests, you'll need a properly configured Python environment with:
- pytest
- pytest-bdd
- pytest-mock
- ib_insync
- pytz

Use the following command to run the tests:
```bash
python -m pytest python/tests/test_ibkr_ib_insync_setup.py -v
```

## Configuration Settings

The following settings are now available in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
# IBKR API Connection
ibkr:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 7497  # TWS: 7497, IB Gateway: 4001
  client_id: 1
  read_only: false
  account: ""  # Set your account ID or leave blank to use active account
  use_ib_insync: true  # Use new implementation instead of placeholder
  timeout: 20  # Connection timeout in seconds
  auto_reconnect: true  # Automatically try to reconnect on disconnection
  max_rate: 45  # Maximum API requests per second (IB's limit is 50)
```
